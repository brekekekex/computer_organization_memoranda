    "Most (if not all) of the students taking this course should have been acquainted with Hardware Description Languages (HDLs) by way of FPGA-programming with [Verilog](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1620780). I say 'acquainted' because you will be friends with Verilog by the end of ECE 200.\n",

    "In particular, the most important project of the semester involves the description of a complete processor. Instead of synthesizing your model with Quartus, however, you will be compiling and simulating it using [Verilator](https://www.veripool.org/wiki/verilator). \n",
    "\n",
    "Invariably, this project ends up being a trial by fire. You will not have encountered many of the constructs and idiosyncrasies you will be encountering (such as procedural description, registers, and blocking assignment). Still, we would like this to actually be a *constructive* challenge; we will help you to help yourselves.\n",

    "There is an astonishing dearth of resources when it comes to learning Verilog. To my knowledge, the best guides found online are:\n",

    "-[Asic World](http://www.asic-world.com/verilog/veritut.html), a tutorial which looks to have not been updated since the turn of the millennium, but is by many accounts a sort of Gospel.\n",

    "-[HDLBits](https://hdlbits.01xz.net/wiki/Main_Page), a series of exercises built on top of a nice interface for [Icarus Verilog](http://iverilog.icarus.com/)&mdash;built by a monstrously productive TA at the University of Toronto. \n",
    "\n",
    "I recommend getting up to speed by going through all the important exercises on HDLBits (at minimum, do the combinational logic ones&mdash;among other things, you'll find that Verilog refers to 'bit vectors' as simply *vectors*). I myself have neither the knowledge nor the inclination to write an extensive commentary on hardware description. Instead, what I'm going to do is showcase some code that is foundational for what we will be building down the line. If any of it is alarming, you'll have plenty of time to address your questions before the start of Project 3. In this sense, you'll at least know what you don't know.\n",

    "The exercise I have in mind is the design of a 32-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU). I'll discuss ALUs in the context of the von Neumann architecture in some later memo, but for the time being, we'll content ourselves with the notion that an ALU is the part of a processor that does algebra, either Boolean or over $\\mathbb{Z}$. Our ALU will be exceedingly primitive:\n",

    "It will take two 32-bit operands A and B as input vectors. A single selection bit S will control whether we want to add ($C = A+B$) or subtract ($C = A-B$), where the output $C$ is another 32-bit vector. Within the ALU, we can further modularize this as\n",
