    "First, the binary representation of an integer is merely a *representation*, a mapping from the integers to the set of bit vectors. Even constraining these mappings to bijections, we are left with $n!$ distinct mappings between any two sets of cardinality $n$, this latter point being illustrated by a simple permutation argument. On an $n$-bit architecture with $2^n$ possible states, we could actually maintain $(2^n)!$ different schemes of representing any range of integers of size $2^n$. On a 2-bit system, for instance, I could map \n",

    "To be absolutely clear, we *could* implement architectures with integer representations in bases other than two. The Soviets built a *ternary* computer in the late 60s (with some notable success). Babbage's *difference engines*, built in the early 19th century, were decimal machines. Here, too, we have a means of discriminating between different options. \n",

    "Those of you who took Professor Michael Huang's ECE 101 might remember him having mentioned (in passing) that the 'best' base is actually $e$. This choice is indeed optimal, subject to a metric known as the *radix economy*. The argument is easily sketched as follows:\n",
