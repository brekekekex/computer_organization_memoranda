    "A *Boolean algebra* is a non-empty set $X$ endowed with binary operations $x\\wedge y$ (conjunction) and $x \\lor y$ (disjunction), along with a unary operation $\\neg x$ (negation), such that the following laws of Boolean logic are observed:\n",

    "Observe that in this domain, the logician's notation for sentential connectives ($\\wedge$, $\\lor$, $\\neg$) is eschewed in favor of the mathematician's notation for generalized algebra ($\\cdot$, $+$, ').

    "To be clear, a Boolean algebra need not be over two elements. For example, the construction of a Boolean algebra over a singleton gives rise to a *degenerate* algebra that is not particularly useful.\n",

    "More interestingly, for any non-empty set $X$, there is a Boolean 'algebra of sets', $(\\mathcal{P}(X), \\cap, \\cup, C)$, where $\\mathcal{P}(X)$ is the power set of $X$, $\\cap$ is set-intersection, $\\cup$ is set-union, and $A^C$ is the *relative complement of $A$ in $\\mathcal{P}(X)$*, $\\mathcal{P}(X)-A$. Once we identify the additive identity of this algebra as $\\emptyset$ and the multiplicative identity as $X$, it is clear that it satisfies the equations of Boolean logic.\n",

    "for all $A,B$ in the $\\{0,1\\}$ algebra. While this may seem mathematical (and therefore completely useless), it is important to know that such a metaphor exists between digital logic and naive set theory, if only to be able to use the latter to derive certain identities in the former. For example, De Morgan's laws are, in a certain sense, more 'naturally' proven *via* set theory:\n",

    "$$\\phi((A+B)') = \\phi(A+B)^C = (\\phi(A)\\cup \\phi(B))^C = \\phi(A)^C \\cap \\phi(B)^C = \\phi(A') \\cap \\phi(B') = \\phi(A' \\cdot B')$$\n",

    "Lastly, by now, the reader has hopefully noticed the care devoted to the De Morgan duality. This is because it, alongside the minterm canonical form, is undeniably the most powerful result taught in ECE 112, giving rise to the notion of a Universal Gate: \n",

    "Circuit design at scale is made possible by our ability to decompose any Boolean function into the OR-ing of ANDs. With NAND logic, we can further standardize this as the NAND-ing of negations and the negation of NANDs. Needless to say, this result takes priority because we can only optimize that which is possible to engineer."
