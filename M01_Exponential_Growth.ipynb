    "It is more or less obligatory to begin by mentioning *Moore's Law*, which, if it has somewhat lost its conviction over the years, nonetheless remains a robust icebreaker. The Law is usually stated as follows: *the density of components in an integrated circuit doubles about once every two years*. \n",
    "\n",
    "In truth, the force of the Law comes not so much from it saying that transistor density doubles every *two* years as from it saying that it doubles *every* two years&mdash;it says that the growth of transistor density is an exponential process. It would certainly be a category-error to make this sort of remark about something linear ('I double in age every quarter-century') or logarithmic ('Usain Bolt doubles in speed every decade'). Exponential growth is quite special and always transient. Moore's Law is an *aberration*.\n",

    "\n",
    "Finally, we note that the Rule of 72 works best (has minimum error) for *small* values of $r$ (incidentally, around 8 percent). Perhaps what best illustrates the might of Moore's Law is that it corresponds to an annualized rate of *40 percent*.\n",
